  // This file tracks discrepancies where the WIKI is incorrect and the API is correct.
  // These entries are excluded from comparison results to avoid re-reviewing validated data.
  //
  // Format: taskId -> array of field names that have been verified as correct in API
  // Each entry should include a comment with the verification source and date.
  //
  // Run `npx tsx scripts/wiki-task-spike.ts --all --cache` to check for stale entries.
  // Stale entries (wiki now matches API) will be flagged for removal.
